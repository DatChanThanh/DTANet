# DTANet

This paper proposes DTANet, a dual-branch hybrid
architecture that integrates convolutional neural networks and
Transformers to enhance waveform recognition in integrated
radar-communications systems. The model processes high-clarity
spectrograms, generated by smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville dis-
tribution, through two parallel branches to capture fine-grained
local details and model global context with long-range depen-
dencies. As a key innovation, a Decoupled Attention mechanism
separates attention into three complementary paths: Width-wise
Temporal Attention to capture time-varying signatures, Height-
wise Frequency Attention to learn frequency-aware interactions,
and Channel Attention to recalibrate the importance of learned
features, accordingly building a more robust feature represen-
tation while maintaining high computational efficiency. Experi-
ments on a 12-class synthetic waveform dataset show DTANet
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 91.11% accuracy,
0.596 ms inference time, and just 75K parameters. These results
highlight DTANetâ€™s superiority in terms of accuracy, speed, and
compactness, thus recommending it as a robust and efficient
solution for real-time deployment on resource-limited platforms.
